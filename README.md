# PHE Adventures

A VERY quickly abandoned tech demo for a now EXTREMELY defunct "company" known as [Team PHE](https://pikakid98.github.io/weebly-archive/thepikakid98graveyard.weebly.com/team-phe.html) which intended to be tie-in Smash Bros.-like game featuring characters from 3 now defunct co-.. ok.. 1 defunct company and 2 companies that were never registered.. For context. The "PHE" in Team PHE (Pronounced "Fee") stands for Pikakid98 Studios (Now Pikakid98 Games), Hand In The Cookie Jar Productions (Now Not-So Classic Games) and EyeShellGames (Now.. fucking nothing). Built on top of PurrCatory's demo build for whatever reason.. I literally just copied PurrCatory's demo build and just replaced the assets.. wow
